# Python-Game---Cat-House
It is a 2D game based on Python library Pygame for game tutorial.
In this repository, I have provided the traditional game develop framework and many basic game components including game image (.png), game font, button class, popup window (like menu). 
Besides, I have also added some game developing methods like state machine and sprite groups. You could refer to this repository when you have ideas in game development.

Apart from those, you could have fun with this game! It is a kind of formative game, but not exactly. You could raise small cats in the farm, feed them and you will wait ot see how they evolve into
different kinds of cats. You could feed or play with them using some tools I added when you feel tired about your work. Then you could hide the game screen and go back to work. Here are some figures of the game scene.
